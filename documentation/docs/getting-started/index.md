# Getting Started

Welcome to FastC! This section will help you install the compiler, create your first project, and set up your development environment.

## Overview

FastC is a transpiled language - it compiles to C11 code, which is then compiled by your system's C compiler. This gives you:

- **Portability** - Works anywhere C works
- **Performance** - Native code with no runtime overhead
- **Interoperability** - Easy integration with existing C code

## Quick Path

1. **[Installation](installation.md)** - Build FastC from source
2. **[Quick Start](quickstart.md)** - Create and run your first project
3. **[Editor Setup](editor-setup.md)** - Configure your IDE for FastC

## Prerequisites

Before installing FastC, you'll need:

- **Rust toolchain** (1.70 or later) - [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **C compiler** (gcc, clang, or MSVC) - For compiling generated code
- **Git** - For fetching the source code

## What's Next?

After completing this section, you'll be ready to:

- Write FastC programs with proper type safety
- Use the CLI tools for development
- Integrate FastC with your build system
